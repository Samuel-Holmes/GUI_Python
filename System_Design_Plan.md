Creation of a simple calculator using Tkinter library

System requirements:

* Basic operations (addition, subtraction, division, multiplication)
* I would like a running display of the numbers entered as a normal calculator has
* The ability to clear


Methodology:

Start with the base system then add functionality piece by piece. 

First get a display of current total/number entered and the buttons working.

Implement a frame within window and then assign each button a value of the number string
