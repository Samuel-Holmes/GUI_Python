## Understanding graphical interfaces within the Python programming language

This project was undertaken to allow understanding of creating GUI with the Tkinter library in Python. I wanted to undertake this project because it was a topic that I was interested to learn, I could also see the benefit of learning such a skill when it came to future projects.
